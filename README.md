# 🌈 Hue Muse: Inspiration through color.

## 🖌️ What is Hue Muse?  
Colors evoke emotions, and as a designer, I carefully consider the colors I use in my projects. Hue Muse was created to inspire creativity through endless harmonious color combinations. The design is inspired by Josef Albers' iconic nested squares, which showcase the interplay of color. His minimalist approach emphasizes the emotional and aesthetic power of color—perfectly aligning with the purpose of Hue Muse. 
This program generates color combinations arranged in nested quares which offers a visually engaging way to explore and use color. Simply click on a hovered square to copy it's hex code.

## 🚀 Tech Behind the Magic  
Before building Hue Muse, my web development experience was limited to creating my portfolio site. For this project, I decided to learn and use **React** and **JavaScript**, which provided:  
- A **component-based architecture** for clean and reusable code  
- **Efficient rendering** for a smooth user experience  

### 🛠️ Features  
- **Infinite combinations**: Each refresh brings fresh, unique palettes.  
- **Responsive design**: A lightweight, mobile-friendly experience.  
- **Future enhancements**: I plan to learn TypeScript to improve type safety and create even more robust projects.

## 🎨 Which Hues to Choose?  
Hue Muse generates color pairs using three thoughtful techniques:  

### 1️⃣ **Monochromatic Pairing**  
A random base color is selected, then paired with a lighter or darker version of itself.  

### 2️⃣ **Analogous Pairing**  
A base color is slightly shifted along the hue spectrum, creating subtle variations while retaining cohesion.  

### 3️⃣ **Complementary Pairing**  
A base color is paired with its complementary (opposite) hue, then adjusted for balance to avoid harsh contrasts.  

💡 *Finding the right balance of randomness and range took trial and error, but the results speak for themselves.*
